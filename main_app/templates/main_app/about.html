  <h4 class="border-bottom border-gray pb-2 mb-2">About The Early Warning System:</h4>
  <p>This tool was created to help system administrators keep track of common enterprise software updates. This automated system is constantly crawling software vendor websites for the latest version data. Once a new version is detected an automated email is sent to the list of accounts who have subscribed to that specific software. Users can choose which application version changes they want to notified of. Users can change their subscriptions at any time. If you no longer want to receive emails from this site then just sign in and delete your account from "account settings"</p>
  <h5>How often does the system check for version changes?</h5>
  <p>The system checks vendor websites every 6 hours.</p>
  <h5>About the author:</h5>

  <h5>Privacy policy:</h5>
  <p>All passwords and emails are stored securely. The Early Warning System will never share your information with anyone. Only emails regarding software updates, activation and maintenance will be sent to you.</p>
