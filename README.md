This tool was created to help system administrators keep track of common enterprise software updates. This automated system is constantly crawling software vendor websites for the latest version data. Once a new version is detected an automated email is sent to the list of accounts who have subscribed to that specific software. Users can choose which application version changes they want to notified of. Users can change their subscriptions at any time.

The tool was made if Django 2.2.4
